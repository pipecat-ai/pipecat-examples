## Prerequisites

### Telnyx

- A Telnyx account with:
  - API Key
  - A purchased phone number that supports voice calls

### AI Services

- OpenAI API key for the LLM inference
- Deepgram API key for speech-to-text
- Cartesia API key for text-to-speech

### System

- Python 3.10+
- `uv` package manager
- ngrok (for local development)
- Docker (for production deployment)

## Setup

1. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```sh
   cd inbound
   uv sync
   ```

2. Create an .env file and add API keys:

   ```sh
   cp env.example .env
   ```

## Local development

To run the twilio-chatbot for inbound calling locally, we'll first set up an ngrok tunnel and a TeXML application. Then, we'll run our bot and call into it to speak with the bot.

### Configure Telnyx TeXML application

1. Start ngrok:
   In a new terminal, start ngrok to tunnel the local server:

   ```sh
   ngrok http 7860
   ```

   > Tip: Use the `--subdomain` flag for a reusable ngrok URL.

2. If you haven't already, purchase a number from Telnyx.

   - Log in to the Telnyx developer portal: https://portal.telnyx.com/
   - Buy a number: https://portal.telnyx.com/#/numbers/buy-numbers

3. Create your TeXML Bin:

   - Go to your TeXML Bin configuration page: https://portal.telnyx.com/#/call-control/texml-bin
   - Create a new TeXML Bin
   - In the "Name" field, provide a name
   - Leave the "URL" field blank
   - In the "Content" field, add the TeXML:

     ```xml
      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
         <Response>
         <Connect>
            <Stream url="wss://your-url.ngrok.io/ws" bidirectionalMode="rtp"></Stream>
         </Connect>
         <Pause length="40"/>
      </Response>
     ```

4. Create a Telnyx TeXML application:

   - Go to your TeXML configuration page: https://portal.telnyx.com/#/call-control/texml
   - Create a new TeXML app, if one doesn't exist already:
     - Add an application name
     - Under Webhooks, select POST as the "Voice Method"
     - Select "TeXML Bin URL" under Webhook URL Method
     - Select the TeXML Bin you created in the previous step
     - Click "Create" to save
       Note: You'll see subsequent pages to set up SIP and Outbound, both are not required, so just skip.

5. Add TeXML application to your number:
   - Navigate to "Manage Numbers" (https://portal.telnyx.com/#/numbers/my-numbers)
   - Select the pencil icon next to the phone number of interest and select the TeXML application that you just created

### Run your bot

The bot.py file uses the Pipecat development runner, which runs a FastAPI server in order to receive connections.

1. To get started, we'll run our bot.py file:

   ```bash
   uv run bot.py --transport telnyx --proxy your_ngrok_url
   ```

   > Replace `your_ngrok_url` with your ngrok URL (e.g. your-subdomain.ngrok.io)

2. Call the number associated with your TeXML applicaiton. Your bot will answer and begin talking to you!

## Production deployment

To deploy your telnyx-chatbot for inbound calling, we'll use [Pipecat Cloud](https://pipecat.daily.co/).

### Deploy your Bot to Pipecat Cloud

Follow the [quickstart instructions](https://docs.pipecat.ai/getting-started/quickstart#step-2%3A-deploy-to-production) for tips on how to create secrets, build and push a docker image, and deploy your agent to Pipecat Cloud.

### Configure Telnyx for production

You'll want to purchase additional phone numbers for your production use. You can follow the steps above.

To run on Pipecat Cloud, the one change you'll have to make is to your TeXML Bin. You'll need to update the websocket URL to point to Pipecat Cloud. Your TeXML should look like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
   <Connect>
      <Stream url="wss://api.pipecat.daily.co/ws/telnyx?serviceHost=AGENT_NAME.ORGANIZATION_NAME" bidirectionalMode="rtp"></Stream>
   </Connect>
   <Pause length="40"/>
</Response>
```

Replace:

- `AGENT_NAME` with the name of the agent you deployed in the previous stepyour deployed agent name
- `ORGANIZATION_NAME` with your Pipecat Cloud organization name

### Call your Bot

Your bot file is now deployed to Pipecat Cloud and Telnyx is configured to receive calls. Dial the number associated with your bot to start a conversation!
