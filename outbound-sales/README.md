# Outbound Sales Bot

Meet Hailey, an outbound sales agent built with Pipecat. She calls a list of leads in batches of 5 over Daily PSTN, introduces herself ("Hi, this is Hailey from Pipecat Labs. Am I speaking with Beau?"), and tries to reach the person who handles IT decisions. She either gets transferred or collects the decision maker's contact info, reports it to the server (which logs it to the terminal), says thanks, and hangs up.

The example also shows the new **Pipecat evals** feature: the same bot runs in a text-only eval mode so you can test its behavior in seconds, with no phone calls and no audio.

This project was scaffolded with the Pipecat CLI:

```bash
pipecat init outbound-sales --bot-type telephony -t daily_pstn_dialout \
  --daily-pstn-mode dial-out -m cascade \
  --stt deepgram_stt --llm openai_llm --tts cartesia_tts --eval
```

## How It Works

```
leads.csv → dialer.py → server.py /dialout → Daily room + dial-out
                                              ↓
server.py /call_result ← bot.py (Hailey) ← call answered
```

1. `dialer.py` reads `leads.csv` and starts calls in batches of 5
2. For each lead, `server.py` creates a Daily room with dial-out enabled and starts a bot
3. The bot dials the lead's number; when they answer, Hailey runs the conversation
4. Hailey saves contact info with the `save_contact_info` tool and hangs up with the `end_call` tool
5. Every finished call reports one outcome row to `server.py`, which logs it to the terminal and keeps it in memory; the dialer polls `GET /results` to know when a batch is done, then starts the next batch. (This is a demo: a real production app would save outcomes to a database instead.)

## Configuration

- **Bot Type**: Telephony
- **Transport(s)**: Daily PSTN (Dial-out), plus an eval transport for testing
- **Pipeline**: Cascade
  - **STT**: Deepgram
  - **LLM**: OpenAI
  - **TTS**: Cartesia

> **Note**: This example currently installs `pipecat-ai` from the `main` branch on GitHub, because the CLI and evals features are newer than the latest PyPI release. Once 1.4.0 ships, switch the dependency in `server/pyproject.toml` to the PyPI version.

## Setup

All commands run from the `server/` directory.

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies

   ```bash
   cd server
   uv sync
   ```

2. Set up environment variables

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   ```

3. Buy a phone number

   Instructions on how to do that can be found at this [docs link](https://docs.daily.co/reference/rest-api/phone-numbers/buy-phone-number)

4. Request dial-out enablement

   For compliance reasons, to enable dial-out for your Daily account, you must request enablement via the form. You can find out more about dial-out, and the form, at the [link here](https://docs.daily.co/guides/products/dial-in-dial-out#main)

## Test Hailey with Evals (no phone needed)

Evals drive the bot over a local WebSocket in text mode: no telephony, no audio, no waiting. An OpenAI model (gpt-4o-mini) judges the responses, so only `OPENAI_API_KEY` is needed.

Run the whole suite (spawns a fresh bot per scenario):

```bash
uv run pipecat eval suite evals.yaml
```

Expected output:

```
  ✓ bot.py gatekeeper_refusal (8089ms)
  ✓ bot.py happy_path (14954ms)
  ✓ bot.py transfer_path (18785ms)

  3/3 passed  ·  19.3s
```

The scenarios live in `scenarios/`:

- `happy_path.yaml`: the lead hands over the IT director's contact info
- `transfer_path.yaml`: a gatekeeper transfers Hailey to the IT director
- `gatekeeper_refusal.yaml`: "take us off your list"; Hailey must not argue

To iterate on a single scenario:

```bash
# Terminal 1 (Hailey exits when she hangs up, so restart between runs)
uv run bot.py -t eval

# Terminal 2
uv run pipecat eval run scenarios/happy_path.yaml -v
```

This is the fast dev loop: tweak the system prompt in `bot.py`, re-run the suite, repeat.

## Run a Real Call

You'll need two terminal windows open:

1. **Terminal 1**: Start the webhook server:

   ```bash
   uv run server.py
   ```

   This runs on port 8080 and handles dial-out requests.

2. **Terminal 2**: Start the bot server:

   ```bash
   uv run bot.py -t daily
   ```

   This runs on port 7860 and handles the bot logic.

3. **Test a single call**

   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/dialout" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "dialout_settings": { "phone_number": "+15551234567" },
       "lead": { "phone": "+15551234567", "name": "Beau", "company": "Acme Robotics" }
     }'
   ```

   Answer the call and have a chat with Hailey. When the call ends, the outcome is logged in the webhook server's terminal (Terminal 1).

## Run a Batch Campaign

Edit `leads.csv` with real numbers (`phone,name,company`), then with both servers running:

```bash
uv run dialer.py
```

The dialer calls in batches of 5, waits for every call in a batch to finish (or time out after 6 minutes), then starts the next batch. Leads that already have a result are skipped, so you can stop and re-run the dialer while the server stays up.

Each result row is logged to the server terminal and has: timestamp, call_id, lead phone/name/company, outcome, contact name/role/phone/email, notes. Outcomes are `contact_captured`, `refused`, `wrong_number`, `transferred_no_info`, `other`, `hung_up`, `no_answer`, `dialout_error`, `timeout`, or `error`.

> **Production note**: results live in the server's memory and are gone when it restarts. That's on purpose: this is a demo, and the in-memory store plus terminal logging stand in for a database. In a real production app, have `POST /call_result` write to a database, and remember that on Pipecat Cloud each bot runs in its own container, so `SERVER_URL` must point at a server the bots can reach (not localhost).

## Environment Configuration

The bot supports two deployment modes controlled by the `ENV` variable:

### Local Development (`ENV=local`)

- Uses your local server for handling dial-out requests and starting the bot
- Default configuration for development and testing

### Production (`ENV=production`)

- Bot is deployed to Pipecat Cloud; requires `PIPECAT_API_KEY` and `PIPECAT_AGENT_NAME`
- Set these when deploying to production environments
- Your FastAPI server runs either locally or deployed to your infrastructure

Key pieces in `bot.py`:

- **Dual-mode entry point**: `bot()` detects eval runs (`-t eval`) and serves the eval WebSocket transport instead of dialing out. Real calls use `DailyTransport` with full audio.
- **`save_contact_info` tool**: stores the decision maker's name, role, phone, and email on the call result.
- **`end_call` tool**: flushes the pipeline (so the goodbye and tool events are delivered), then shuts down gracefully. Hanging up is just the bot leaving the Daily room.
- **`DialoutManager`**: retries the dial-out up to 5 times before giving up.

## Deploying to Pipecat Cloud

This project is configured for deployment to Pipecat Cloud. You can learn how to deploy in the [Pipecat Quickstart Guide](https://docs.pipecat.ai/getting-started/quickstart#step-2-deploy-to-production).

> **Before you deploy**: update the fields in `server/pcc-deploy.toml` for your own account. `image` points at the example author's Docker Hub repo, so change it to your own registry repo and tag. Also set `agent_name` to the agent name in your Pipecat Cloud account and `secret_set` to the secret set you created with `pipecat cloud secrets set`.

Refer to the [Pipecat Cloud Documentation](https://docs.pipecat.ai/deployment/pipecat-cloud/introduction) to learn more about configuring, deploying, and managing your agents. Remember the production note above: the in-memory results store needs replacing with a database (and a reachable `SERVER_URL`) when bots run in separate containers.
